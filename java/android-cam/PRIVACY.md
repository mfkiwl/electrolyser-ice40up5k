Application Privacy Policy
==========================

CameraServe **does not** ask for or collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, etc.

Metadata may be sent to Google servers as part of standard Play Store information gathering. This can potentially be avoided via APK sideloading.

Camera images (MJPEG streams) are only sent to devices that explicitly request them. It is your responsibility to ensure that your devices that are running CameraServe are secured on your network and not exposed to the Internet. By default, CameraServe will refuse to communicate with publicly routable Internet Protocol addresses; it is not recommended to disable this feature.

Any changes to this privacy policy will be reflected in the latest copy of this file.
